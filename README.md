# UnityFPSMovement
THIS IS AN UNFINISHED PROJECT

For working on my First-Person character controller in Unity.

My intention is to make a character controller that I can use in my other projects with minimal stress. If you wanted to use the code in your own project I don't mind, but I can't guarantee it's better than other code you'll find, plus you're better off learning how to do this kind of thing yourself.

Credit is always appreciated but not required.

Current features:
  -Simple camera controls with adjustable sensitivity
  
Planned features (in order of priority):

  -Basic physics-based walking and jumping
	
  -Sprinting
	
  -Crouching
	
  -Slow walking
	
  -Tweaked for wall running/jumps if i'm feeling spicy (BIG MAYBE, but would be a seperate project)
